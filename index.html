                <img src="https://www.giallozafferano.com/images/ricette/228/22822/1.jpg" alt="step by step cacio 1">
                <p>
                  To prepare spaghetti cacio e pepe, first of all grate the Pecorino cheese. Continue boiling some water in a pan (use about half of what you usually use to cook pasta, so it will be richer in starch) and when it boils you can add salt to taste. Once salted, you can cook the spaghetti <span class="num-step">1</span>. In the meantime, pour the whole peppercorns on a cutting board <span class="num-step">2</span>, then crush them with a meat pestle or a grinder <span class="num-step">3</span>. This will release more of the pungent scent of the pepper.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <img src="https://www.giallozafferano.com/images/ricette/228/22822/2.jpg" alt="step by step cacio 2">
                <p>
                  Pour half of the crushed pepper into a large non-stick pan <span class="num-step">4</span>, toast over low heat stirring with a wooden spoon, then add a couple of ladles of cooking water <span class="num-step">5</span>. The bubbles you see appearing are from the starch contained in the water. Drain the spaghetti when it is very al dente (keeping the cooking water aside to use later) and pour the pasta directly into the pan with toasted pepper <span class="num-step">6</span>; it will continue cooking with the seasoning.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <img src="	https://www.giallozafferano.com/images/ricette/228/22822/3.jpg" alt="step by step cacio 3">
                <p>
                  Stir the pasta continuously with the kitchen tongs to make it “breathe" <span class="num-step">7</span> and add a ladle of water or two if necessary, to continue cooking <span class="num-step">8</span>. Keep pouring a ladle of water only when needed (when you see that the pan is almost completely dry) and stir with kitchen tongs. In the meantime, when the pasta is ready, prepare the Pecorino cream (don't start this operation before because the cream would get too thick): pour about half of the grated Pecorino cheese into a bowl <span class="num-step">9</span>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <img src="https://www.giallozafferano.com/images/ricette/228/22822/4.jpg" alt="step by step cacio 4">
                <p>
                  Add a ladle of cooking water to the grated Pecorino cheese <span class="num-step">10</span>. Stir vigorously with a whisk <span class="num-step">11</span> and add more water when needed. Then add the remaining half of the Pecorino cheese, keeping a little bit aside to garnish later <span class="num-step">12</span>. Add a little more water if needed: at this stage you will have to carefully adjust the amount of Pecorino cheese to the water to obtain a cream of the right consistency and without lumps.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <img src="	https://www.giallozafferano.com/images/ricette/228/22822/5.jpg" alt="step by step cacio 5">
                <p>
                  Finish cooking your pasta, adding a little more hot water if necessary; before adding the Pecorino cream, briefly stir the cream by placing the bowl over the steam of the pan with hot water, always stir with the whisk <span class="num-step">13</span>, so as to bring the cream back to a temperature similar to the one of your pasta if necessary <span class="num-step">14</span>. Turn the heat off under the pan with spaghetti and pour in the Pecorino cream <span class="num-step">15</span>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <img src="https://www.giallozafferano.com/images/ricette/228/22822/6.jpg" alt="step by step cacio 6">
                <p>
                  While pouring the Pecorino cream onto your spaghetti, stir it continuously with the kitchen tongs <span class="num-step">16</span>, pour the Pecorino you kept aside in too <span class="num-step">17</span>, stir and sauté the pasta again, then transfer your spaghetti cacio e pepe to a plate and season with the remaining pepper, enjoy immediately in all its creaminess <span class="num-step">18</span>!

              <li>Gruyère - 100 g, grated</li>
              <li>4 thin slices of great smoked ham</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section class="steps">
            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                First, make a perfect béchamel sauce. Put the milk, cream, garlic, bay leaves and onion in a small pan over a medium heat and stir together. Heat until nearly boiling, then turn the heat off and leave for 10 mins to infuse. Pass the liquid through a sieve and discard the bay and onion.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                Melt the butter with the flour in another pan and cook over a gentle heat until it smells biscuity. Gradually whisk in the warm milk and bring to a gentle boil, stirring regularly, then add the Dijon mustard, a little grating of fresh nutmeg and some seasoning. It should be a lovely thick creamy sauce with a deep flavour.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                Brush the slices of bread with melted butter. Place them on a baking tray and toast one side under a grill, buttered-side up, until golden. Take them out and heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                Turn the bread over and spread each slice with a thin layer of Dijon, followed by a layer of the béchamel. Cover the sauce with grated gruyère, and then a slice of ham. Form the slices into two sandwiches, spread a thin layer of the sauce over the top slice and sprinkle more gruyère on top. Put the sandwiches in the oven and bake for 10-15 mins or until golden. Mix the mustard and mayo together and serve alongside.
                </p>

              <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
              <p>The title Croque Monsieur comes from “croquer”, to bite and “monsieur” meaning mister. It's literally a gentleman's sandwich. <br> It first appears in literature in a work by Proust, In Search of Lost Time in 1918, but it had featured on menus in Paris as early as 1910.</p>

            <ol id="meat-filling">
              <li>
                <p>
                  In a deep pan on medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Add the onions and garlic and sweat the onions until they are translucent and have begun to slightly brown, three to five minutes. 
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Add the ground beef and cook until there is no pink left, stirring frequently.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  When the meat is mostly finished, add the parsley and all the spices and stir well. Transfer the meat filling to a bowl to cool until the crepes are ready to be stuffed.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>For the pancakes</h4>
            <ol id="pancakes">
              <li>
                <p>
                  In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk or mixer. Add the baking soda and the milk one at a time, beating between each until combined. Divide the batter into two bowls.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  In one bowl, add the flour slowly, whisking or beating between each addition until fully combined with no lumps. The consistency of this batter should be thinner than cake batter, but thicker than milk.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Slowly combine the two batters, pouring the un-floured batter into the other bowl. Beat or whisk until the mixtures have combined completely. The consistency should be thicker than heavy cream, like a very thin pancake batter.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Add the oil and salt and mix until combined.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Heat a non-stick 8-10 inch pan on medium-high heat. Use a cooking spray or coat the pan with a small amount of oil to ensure the crepe doesn’t stick if you do not have a non-stick pan.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Once the pan is heated, add 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and spin to evenly coat the bottom of the pan. Brown each side for one minute, each side will be slightly brown. Set cooked crepe aside and continue working through the entire batter. If you are having difficulty flipping the crepes try adding a bit of cooking spray to your spatula.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Lay the cooled crepe flat and add 2 tablespoons of the filling into the center. Fold each side over and roll toward the top of the crepe to create a burrito-like package, continuing until all the crepes are filled.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  At this point, the crepes can be placed on a sheet pan or in a covered pyrex dish and frozen for a few days until you’re ready to fry.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Working in batches, fry the blinchik on all sides in the pan until browned and crisp. About 2-3 mintues per batch. Take caution to not burn the blinchik.

              <h3>Fun Fact:</h3>
              <p>Blini were considered by early East Slavic people in pre-Christian times to be a symbol of the sun, due to their round form. They were traditionally prepared at the end of winter to honor the rebirth of the new sun (Butter Week, or Maslenitsa, also called "pancake week").</p>
              <p>Blini are highly popular in many countries: Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, Israel and many more.</p>
              <p>
                Blini, or as they are known in Ukrainian, mlyntsi, have been eaten in Ukraine since pre-Christian times.
